  <h2>What is a Dirty Works Jazz Jam?</h2>
</div>

For those not familiar with the traditions of jazz jams, here's the skinny on how Dirty Works Jazz does it...

A Dirty Works Jazz Jam always has house band with a solid rhythm section that includes Kyle Finley on upright bass, keys :musical_keyboard: and/or guitar :guitar:, and usually drums :drum:. Sometimes there's a :trumpet: or :saxophone: out front. Local jazz players are invited to join the group throughout the night.

These are not a casual jam circle kinda thing... These are 100% a performance for the audience to enjoy and also a chance for players to do their thing. With the Dirty Works Jazz Band, the focus is to sound good & have fun... in that order. :sunglasses:

Dirty Works Jazz Jams are run in this way, the house band will kick off the first few songs and players are invited to join after that. Tunes are called on the fly :airplane: and players are swapped out as the night goes. Jams usually run 3 hours with short breaks :clock9:.

Below are some recent photos from jams. Most shots taken by Kyle Finley and are not authorized for use. :crystal_ball:
