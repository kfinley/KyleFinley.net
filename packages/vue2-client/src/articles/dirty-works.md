  The Dirty Works Jazz Band & Jams are led by upright bassist Kyle Finley. The group plays straight ahead classic jazz. This means tunes from the days of Riverside, Impulse, & Blue Note is where it's at... ya feel me?
  
  The group plays gigs as varioius configurations and runs several jams around San Francisco. The first Dirty Works Jazz Jam started in March 2023 at the Lucky Horseshoe. There are some standing members of the group plus a rolling cast of Bay Area players to keep things fresh & size up or down for the gig. The group also plays private events and parties.

  <h2>What is a Dirty Works Jazz Jam?</h2>
</div>

For those not familiar with the traditions of jazz jams, here's the skinny on how The Dirty Works Jazz Jams are run. 

A Dirty Works Jazz Jam always has a rhythym section with upright bass, keys :musical_keyboard: and/or guitar :guitar:, plus drums :drum:. Sometimes there's a :trumpet: or :saxophone: out front. The Dirty Works Jazz Band is what's called the "House Band", the bass player, Kyle Finley, is in charge. Local jazz players are invited to join the group. 

Typically Dirty Works Jams have on average a dozen players & singers. :microphone: Some jams are invite only and some are open for new players to join. Singups need to provide name, instrument or voice, song, & key before playing unless they've been referred by an existing jammer. 

This is not a casual jam circle kinda thing... This is 100% a performance for the audience to enjoy and also to give players a chance to do their thing. With the Diryt Works Jazz Band, the focus is to sound good & have fun... in that order. :sunglasses:

Dirty Works Jazz Jams are run in this way, the house band will kick off the first set with a few songs and players are invited to join in after the first or second song. Tunes are called on the fly :airplane: and swap out players as the goes. Jams usually run 3 hours with short breaks :clock9:.
