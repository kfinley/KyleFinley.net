  <h2>The Dirty Works Jazz Band</h2>
</div>

This is a group I run with a collection of players. We play gigs and host jams around SF. The core players are Jonathan (piano), Eli Kemp (drums), &  Dan Dectis (alto sax). Several other players often play with us including Peter Ild (trumpet), Richard Caceres (piano), Zack Sanders (Guitar), Stu Silverman (Guitar), & more.
