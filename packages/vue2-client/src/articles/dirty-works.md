<p>
Dirty Works is a jazz group I formed a few years ago when I started running jazz jams. This group includes an ongoing mix of Bay Area players. We have some standing members and keep a rolling cast of characters in the group to keep it fresh or handle things when someone is out of pocket.
</p>
<p>
Dirty Works plays a wide mix of songs rooted in swing, bebop, hard-bop, soul, funk, latin, etc. Often we play as a trio or quartet but expand or shrink to fit the gig.

Our jams have on average a dozen players and singers. We try to keep it pretty loose and have a good time. I enjoy shooting phtos now and then when I have another bass player to jump on stage. Below are some photos from the jams. Most photos taken by Kyle Finley and are not authorized for use.
