  The Dirty Works Jazz Band is led by Kyle Finley. We play straight ahead classic jazz. The days of Riverside, Impulse, & Blue Note are where we're at... ya feel me?
  
  We play gigs and we run jams. The first Dirty Works Jam started up in March 2023 at the Lucky Horseshoe and since then we've expanded to half a dozen jams around SF. The group includes an ongoing mix of Bay Area players. We have some standing members and a rolling cast of characters to keep the group fresh & size up or down to the gig. We play private events and parties as well.

  <h2>What is a Dirty Works Jazz Jam?</h2>
</div>

For those not familiar with the traditions of jazz jams, here's the skinny on how Dirty Works runs a jam. 

A Dirty Works Jam always has a rhythym section with upright bass, keys :musical_keyboard: and/or guitar :guitar:, plus drums :drum:. Sometimes we have a :trumpet: and/or :saxophone: out front. The Dirty Works Jazz Band is what's called the "House Band", the bass player is in charge, and we welcome local jazz players to join us. We have on average a dozen players & singers :microphone:. We run both open jams and invite jams. No sign up is needed, just let us know you want to play or sing and we'll fit you in.

This is not a casual jam circle kinda thing... This is 100% a performance for the audience to enjoy and also to give players a chance to do their thing. We strive to sound good & have fun... in that order. :sunglasses:

What we do is this, sometimes we kick off a few songs with just the house band but we invite players to join us pretty much from the start. We call tunes on the fly :airplane:, take requests from the crowd :couple: :dancers: :man_dancing:, and swap out players as we go. Jams usually run 3 hours with short breaks :clock9:. We finish with a big closer featuring anyone that wants to join in. :partying_face: :ghost: :alien: :smiley_cat: :beers:

We try to keep no more than three horn players playing per song. The expectation is if you jump up for a song, then you should know the tune or have a chart/changes ready to read for soloing. We all solo during songs. :musical_score: :notes: The bass player or lead player directs traffic :vertical_traffic_light:. Dirty Works Jams are chart/changes :musical_note: friendly but it's best if singers know the words and don't read off their phones. :singer:

We have around :100: local players come through our jams each month :calendar: and play hundreds of jazz standards. New faces :zany_face: are always showing up and we have a great crew of regulars!!
