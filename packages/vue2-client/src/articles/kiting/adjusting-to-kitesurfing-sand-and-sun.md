Hey everyone.

Posts have been slow on the blog and I have a ton to make up but I'm going to start posting from St. Lucia as much as possible.

I arrived 2 days ago and the weather is warm.  I'll be here for 2 weeks returning to Little Rock on May 6th.  When I arrived it was 87 Degrees and the wind was blowing 18 mph.  I decided to relax the first day and kite on the second day here.  After talking to the local instructor at the shop the winds are best in the morning and die out in the afternoon.  The winds are a bit lighter than I expected right now but it turns out I'm here at the end of their peak season.  I'm not worried about it because I brought my 16m kite (that's big if you're wondering).

My first morning on the water was good.  I have to say I'm really used to kiting on the snow right now so getting back on the water took a little more adjusting than I thought it would.  The big thing I totally forgot about was how little wind you need to ride on the snow compared to the water.  I did throw down some decent jumps though on my first session.  Also being in warm water is Awesome!  The only downside is the sun.  I just spent 6 weeks in the mountains all bundled up since it was the coldest, snowiest spring anyone remembered in Dillon.  So you can imagine I got here being one pasty wide Irish dude.  I loaded up on the sunscreen but the salt water just rips it off of you.  Unfortunately I'm pretty burned today. :(  I'm OK though.  I have plenty of Aloe and I've decided to stay out of the sun during peak day.

The place I'm staying at is exactly what I was hoping for.  I'm at the The Reef.  It is a cafe and bar that specializing in kiteboarding and windsurfing.  They offer huts to stay in that are the cheapest option around.   The rooms are a single room with a bed, desk, and chair.  The back of the room has a private bathroom with an open shower.  It's basic staying but it's perfect for what I want for the trip.  The beds also come with mosquito nets! :)  Yeah, who of you can say you've stayed at a place with mosquito nets?? hah Included with the room is free breakfast.

The restaurant at The Reef is really pretty good.  Lots of food options and really cheap local beer.  The local brew is Piton and tastes similar to Heineken.  The beers run $4 Eastern Caribbean currency which has an exchange rate of about $2.60 EC to $1 US. Not bad if you ask me. :)

So as for the people around where I'm at it's pretty sparse.  I'm on the southern end of the island so I'm very far from all the tourist and cruise ship people.  Thank God!  At The Reef there is currently only a few of us staying here.  There is a couple from Holland that have been on the  island for a week or so.  They did a few days at The Reef and then hit the other side but came back because they like it here.  There is also a Canadian guy that is going to change places and start staying here.  All are great company and at nights it's basically us hanging out and having beers. :)

As for the kiteboarding I'm basically the only one that's here all the time.  Other than the instructor that is.  Yesterday morning a girl walked came by for a kite lesson in the morning.  Turns out she's from Connecticut.  She's volunteering at the local hospital and decided to give kiteboarding a go.  Unfortunately she doesn't have much time but she said she'll be back on Sat. and hopefully she can get on the water.

Also a couple showed up yesterday that are on their honeymoon from Philly.  They both kiteboard but the girl has a hurt back so just the guy was riding.  Unfortunately the wind has been a little light so he was having a tough time getting going.  Still though he was stoked about being in the warm water!

 I'm going to wrap this post up here for now.  I'm on battery power with the laptop so I don't want to burn it all out.  Hopefully i can find a power adapter in the next day or so and don't have to worry about it.  I will try to get pictures up in the next day or so as well.  Cheers for now and hopefully I'll have more exciting stuff to post next time.

Peace,<br>
Kyle
