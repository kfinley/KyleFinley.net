Monday was a really nice and warm day in Boston. First 80º day of the year! Got out and joined the rest of the local kiteboard crew at Pleasure Bay around 3 in the afternoon. Everyone was boosting pretty big on anything from 9's to 12's. I first put up my 12m but was Way overpowered and got it down before getting drug into the water. Thank's to Jean for keeping being quick to land me when he realized it was too much.

I hit the water with my old North 2008 9m and Naish Wakeskate. I'm still committing to the wakeskate this year and determined to get kickflips and hopefully grabbed airs this Season! I rode for a while and was fully powered and got to practicing kickflips but my ankles wore out pretty fast. It's going to take some riding to get used to the weight of the wakeskate. I did get lots of nice big shove-its as well as several solid Big Spins so I was happy with that. All in all a great day on the water and good seeing everyone back on kites for the season.

Here are some pictures I got of the guys during a break from riding.
