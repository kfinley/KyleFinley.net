I have a great roof deck in South Boston with a view of the Boston Harbor and the JFK Library. I enjoy shooting photographs of the harbor and especially the JFK Library. These are a few photos I've taken of rainbows over the harbor. I'll try to update the article with more photos as I take them. All photographs are my own and if you want to use them for anything please contact me first via Twitter [@KFinley](https://twitter.com/kfinley).
