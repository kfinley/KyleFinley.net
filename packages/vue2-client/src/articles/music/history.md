# My Musical Journey

<p>
  I've been playing music now for over 30 years. I grew up hiding out in the band hall with the other cool kids playing lots of stuff.
  When I was 11 I joined beginner band at school. I picked the trombone because that's what my dad played. He let me use his Bach
  Stradivarius Model 42b he bought in high school after he had to quit playing football due to a serious game injury. I'm lucky and come 
  from good stock of musical talent so playing music came pretty naturally for me. I played the trombone through high school and college, 
  then it was almost lost in a house fire so he asked for it back to hold for safe keeping. Luckily I now have my father's horn back and 
  after a few months of chopping wood in Golden Gate Park I'm on my way back to serious playing!

  When I was about 13 I got a cheap electric bass guitar (and an even cheaper garage sale acoustic guitar). I started playing bass
  because of people like Cliff Burton, Les Claypool, Jeff Ament, and Flea. I started taking lessons from my friend and band director
  <a href="http://jeffmadlock.com" target="Jeff">Jeff Madlock</a> and he started grooming me for high school jazz band. I continued with
  guitar, and still play it a lot, but since moving to upright bass in early high school I've considered myself primarily a bass player.
  When it comes to bass I'm most influenced by Ray Brown, Paul Chambers, Oscar Pettiford, Ron Carter, Christian McBride, and of course
  Jimmy Blanton.

  In high school I was a 3 time All-State Jazz Band member, from it's inaugural year through graduation. I also made All-State Orchestra
  on Bass my senior year without ever playing in an orchestra before and performed in both the Jazz and Orchestra bands the same
  weekend. I received both the John Philip Sousa and Louis Armstrong Jazz Award my senior year. I attended the Jamey Aebersold Jazz Camp
  in 1995 where I learned how to walk bass lines from Jamey Aebersold himself (the dude played everything). I attended Arkansas
  Governors School in the Music Area in 1997. Governors School was a great experience for me. I learned a lot! It's a real shame that
  Ava Hutchinson felt compelled to destroy the program for no good reason other than blind ignorant christian conservatism. The
  destruction of the program was a true loss for the Arkansas education system and more importantly it took away an amazing learning
  opportunity for smart kids and gifted artists in the state.

  I took music pretty seriously through the end of high school was set to attend the University of North Florida with a full ride for
  jazz studies but for various reasons I ended up starting at the University of North Texas. UNT wasn't the place or me (30+ freshman 
  bass majors... 4 undergrad spots in a band... that math doesn't work..) and I bounced around schools a bit before landing at the 
  University of Colorado where I played in one of the CU Jazz Combos under Chip Stephens.

  Unfortunately I let music fall to the back burner after college while I was working as a traveling consultant. I tried to get back to
  playing around 2012 but after an overhaul of my bass I was so upset with the result I couldn't even play it. Sadly it sat in the corner 
  for another 6 years or so before I started playing seriously again. My advice to anyone with a bass they really care about that needs restored, 
  don't use a luthier unless you've used them before. If you have a $10k+ bass you want work done on, first go buy a bass for $1k that needs 
  work and have them work on it to see if you're happy with it and how they operate. As a bonus you can then sell that bass to fund the repair 
  on your main axe, or keep it as a backup.

  Getting back to playing bass was interesting, I randomly meet a Berklee Comp kid while kiteboarding at Revere Beach in Boston and he invited 
  me to join him at a bluegrass jam in Jamaica Plain. I thought why not, bluegrass is easy enough right? And that should be a good place to 
  get my chops back! So I started playing bass with them weekly. They're a great crew and lately they play Sundays at a bar or brewery in 
  Jamaica Plain or at the JP pond in the summer.

  In the summery of 2019 I finally escaped Boston and found myself in SF. I went to The Lucky Horseshoe weekly bluegrass jam run then by Frank
  Holmes my first week in town. I was the regular bass player for the Shoe Jam for almost 4 years, from July 2019 through the pandemic and into 
  it's transition to a new leader (roughly May 2023). I still play the Shoe Jam now and then but I've handed over the torch to a great bass player 
  and friend that enjoys, and knows, bluegrass much more than I do.

  I started focusing on jazz again as my primary genre a few years back and these days I'm playing around SF with a few groups. I host multiple
  jazz jams around town including the Open Jazz Jam at <a href="https://www.theluckyhorseshoebar.com/" target="Shoe">The Lucky Horseshoe</a> 
  every 3rd, 4th, & 5th Wednesday of the month, the Open Jazz Jam every Monday at <a href="https://www.waystone-sf.com/" target="Waystone">Waystone</a> 
  in North Beach, and an invite jam every Thrusday <a href="https://www.persona-sf.com/" target="Persona">Persona</a>. You can also catch me at 
  Wayston on Tuesdays with a trio plus occasional drop-ins. I also play around town with a handful of other groups. My full schedule can be found 
  on my <router-link to="/music">Music Page</router-link>

<p>
  I'm available for hire and looking for players to form both a regular gigging jazz group and a progressive bluegrass / Americana
  group. You can reach me directly at <a href="mailto:kyle@kylefinley.net">Kyle@KyleFinley.net</a>.
