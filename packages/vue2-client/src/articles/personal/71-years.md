My father's 71st birthday would have been last Saturday. I'm very late on sitting down to write this and I know it'll be a struggle as the number increases but I'll do my best. I was happy to be able to play jazz on my Dad's birthday and I wish he could have lived longer so he could have seen me play music again.

What a year it's been. It's hard to put into words how the last year has been. I threw myself into music and played more than I've ever played. I started playing trombone again and after a few months of daily practicing could almost hang at jams! I broke through a lot of barriers on bass and I'm a better player than I've ever been. I've also played out more in the last year then I probably have total in my life, but it's unfortunately come at the cost of my hearing. 

I'll try not to go into too much detail of what I've been dealing with but, I unfortunately experienced a(nother) sudden loss of hearing event about 6 months ago. I'm confident in saying that it was caused by a couple drummers I played a few gigs with and some loud environments I was playing in. I can definitely pinpoint a few single events that most likely caused damage to my right ear.  

This isn't the first time I've experienced a sudden loss of hearing. My left ear was damaged when I was an early teen by a gunshot. In addition to that, at a previous jam I played at weekly I started to notice the an onstage monitor was killing my left ear. Unfortunately now that ear has lost a lot of hearing in the normal frequency ranges and as a result I have a combination of sounds being distorted / mispitched (basically hearing overtones considerably louder than fundamentals and in some cases not hearing the fundamental at all) and symptoms of hyperacusis (pain & irritation mostly).

I've honestly just started to get a grasp on this and the first step was taking a break from playing out and using ear plugs every day for a few weeks. That helped me come to grasp with things but did little to help my hearing. Finding the right ear protection to use while playing has been the biggest step. I'm trying a set of professional musician level active hearing protection earplugs and they work pretty well. I've only played a few times with them but it's night and day compared to the heavier earplugs I've been using.

Unfortunately over he last few months I've had a lot of really bad gigs. They've been bad for me and bad for those around me. I've lost the trust and confidence of the people I've been playing with, which really sucks. It's been really hard. I've also reached my boiling point of dealing with mediocre singers. And not surprisingly my playing progress slowed to a grind. 

So I've made changes and will continue to make changes that prioritize my hearing and mental health over playing in bad environments and being a live backing track to a mediocre singer. I'm actively doing several things to help tone down my left ear's sensitivity including white noise and using iPod 2s transparency mode with ambient noise reduction and varying levels of amplification. In addition to the new musician earplugs I also use a variety of other earplugs depending on the situation. I also use decibel meter apps to check sound levels while playing with other people.

So... longer than I wanted but wanted to get it out. The hearing situation is a bummer but the music has been mostly good. 

71... It was always so hard for me to imagine what my father would be like as he aged. I used to try to mentally project and image and think how I'd try to help him. I was there with him when he tried to take care of his father. He really couldn't do it. His world was just not setup to handle that. I remember sitting there with him in living room of the A Frame listening to my Grandfather over a baby monitor while he thrash around, our overnight caregiver praying out loud standing over him. Or when we were there, me under my Grandfather's right shoulder, my dad under his left, as we held him up and my dad wiped his ass as he started to sob. Just a few of the many powerful mental images I relive from that time. It made me think a lot about how things would be with my dad. I kinda knew I never would have to worry about it but I thought somehow there'd be more time.

Sabrina and I went to Park City this year and naturally I was reminded of our trips to Colorado. I wish things had been different but I do have some good memories from those times. I still use the big snow clothes gear bag for our camping bed bad. Most things I use regularly have a direct connection to my father. 

This next year there will be many big changes. Each year is harder and harder but we keep going. The old cabin is going to continue to get work done on it. The bass boat is going to get used this year. And on the music front I'm going to learn piano, retrain my ear, sing more, play trombone more, solidify solid players to form a group with, and try to record some.

Happy Birthday Dad! I miss you so much. I'll work harder to find a way to be better.
