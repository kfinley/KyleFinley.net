Here is a proposal for a Product Team setup I prepared for the owner and CEO, CTO, and CPO of a sports app company I previously worked with.

I joined the company with the expectation that I would (single-handedly... :roll_eyes:) rebuild their back-end infrastructure from an archaic legacy .NET monolith (single massive EC2 deployment... :unamused:) that was built on an extremely poorly designed and implemented custom database driven queuing system all riding on top of a failed Redis caching structure that contained insanely large json blobs for user data (I have many thoughts... none of them are good :cursing_face:).

The company's issues went much deeper than their crumbling 10+ year old legacy backend and after the sudden death of the head of product in front of the company during an all hands meeting (stress much? :raised_eyebrow:), I got sucked into attempting to help the company establish some kind of sane form of product development. The company went through some tough months due to a complete and total lack of consistent leadership, horrible project management (PM walked with no notice... :fu:), toxic team members, and hidden outside consultants.

After a few months of epic failure and infighting within teams (lack of leadership... :sleeping:) a new head of product was brought in. This (previous outside consultant) didn't grasp the full challenges they were up against and their recommendations were not something I was willing to work under. I prepared this presentation to deliver to the CEO, CTO, and new Head of Product. I was fired by the CTO the day before I was set to deliver it. That CTO wasn't at the company anymore a few months after I was gone :shrug:

I shared this presentation with the owner and CEO following my release. I now share it publicly for educational and archival purposes.
