Here's a proposal for a Product Team setup I prepared for the CEO, CTO, and CPO of a sports app company I previously worked with.

I joined the company with their expectation that I would (single-handedly... :roll_eyes:) rebuild their back-end infrastructure from an archaic legacy .NET monolith (single massive EC2 deployment... :unamused:) that was built on an extremely poorly designed and implemented custom database driven queuing system all riding on top of a failed Redis caching structure that contained insanely large json blobs for user data (I have many thoughts... none of them are good :cursing_face:). In reality the system was as they say in the housing business "a teardown." The decision was made to attempt to carve off systems and wholesale replace them as we went. This plan deserves it's own post/deck and may get one.

The company's issues unfortunately went much deeper than their crumbling 10 year old legacy backend. After the sudden death of the head of product during an all-hands company meeting (stress much? :raised_eyebrow:), I got sucked into attempting to help the company establish some kind of sane form of product development. The company went through some tough months due to a complete and total lack of consistent leadership, horrible project management (the joke of a PM ended up walking giving no notice... :fu:), an extremely combative toxic team member that owned areas of the code and refused to allow others to work in it, typical career level jockeying from an opportunistic manager, and hidden outside consultant influences.

After a few months of epic failure, fast learning, and infighting within teams (lack of leadership... :sleeping:) a new head of product was brought in. This (previous outside consultant) is a nice person but they didn't grasp the full challenges the team was up against and their recommendations were not something I was willing to work under after the unacceptable toxic situation I had been put in. I prepared this presentation to deliver to the CEO, CTO, and new Head of Product as a way to come to an agreement on how I would stay working at the company. I was fired by the CTO the day before I was set to deliver the presentation. That CTO wasn't at the company anymore a month or so after that. :shrug:

I shared this presentation with the owner and CEO following my release. I now share it publicly for educational and archival purposes.
