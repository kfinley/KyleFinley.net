Here's a presentation I prepared for the LeanBox executive team in early May 2016 that lays out the Lean Scrum framework I had implemented at the company. At this point I had been working with LeanBox for about four months and had taken on the role of Team Lead and Scrum Master. I implemented a framework I had developed over the years which helped the team move past some process and tech troubles that had been preventing them from delivering features to production in a timely manor.

The Lean Scrum process uses Dan North's BDD style User Stories as well as the traditional Scrum team roles, artifacts, and rituals. The team was using Trello for managing story cards so the presentation is geared toward that. I prepared this presentation in the early morning hours of May 16th after being <strike>told</strike> asked to deliver a presentation to the executives explaining how we were doing our work.
