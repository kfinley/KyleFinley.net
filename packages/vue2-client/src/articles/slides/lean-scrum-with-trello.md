Here is my presentation that lays out a simple Lean Scrum Framework I've developed over the years that uses Dan North's BDD style User Stories as well as the traditional Scrum team roles, artifacts, and rituals. This presentation shows the framework being used with Trello but it could be used with any board based system (including note cards on the wall). The majority of this presentation is an adaptation of a deck I prepared in the very early morning hours on May 16th for the executives of LeanBox explaining how we ran product development.

This framework uses a 3 week Sprint which includes 2 distinct iteration, a Feature Iteration and a Stabilization, Testing, & Release Iteration (STR Iteration). I've used this style of 3 week Sprint at multiple companies and have had extremely good success. I've yet to see anyone else recommend this approach of distinct iterative cycles within a Sprint. The key to this setup is that these iterations are fluid. While in an ideal world we'd like to finish all the work we commit to in the allotted Feature Iteration time (in this setup we're using 2 weeks but it could be more or less) unfortunately the reality of software product development doesn't always line up with this. To help alleviate the unnecessary pain and frustration experienced by both product development team members and stakeholders (managers, execs, etc.) this framework provides the ability to let incomplete work spill over into the STR Iteration.  hisThe reasons I like this approach are because it helps overcome of the inherent failures that come with a standard N-week sprint which include (but are not limited to)...

- No time for Testing/QA (Dumping a Sprint worth of work on QA at the end of a Sprint & expecting them to test it will always fail. This is insanity and should be avoided.)
- Incomplete work during the sprint (pushing stories or blowing sprints to finish)
- No time for planning the next sprint
- No time to demo and incorporate feedback

This framework also includes a concept called Consumed Points. This is also something I've not come across with other teams and have developed and used periodically throughout the years. Consumed Points are in contrast to Story Points and are a number put on a User Story when the story is considered Done. This value is to include all true effort put into the story by all team members who worked on the story. The purpose of the metric is to capture at the time of completion the most accurate number that represents the effort put into the story. These values can be used in future story point estimation sessions when considering the best guess Story Point to put on a similar feature.

Would I use this framework now? Yes... and no. Typical consultant answer right? As with most everything it depends on the company, product, & team. I would use most of the concepts from this but I would most likely modify the length of the iterations within a sprint. I've wanted to experiment with a 1 week Feature Iteration followed by a 1 week STR Iteration. This seems to match the reality of the last few shops I've worked in (example: Sprint ends on Friday and release is on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. Most stories aren't done and push into Monday [or Tuesday]. The Sprint officially starts on Monday but half the team is usually working on the previous weeks release and not working on current sprint work. This cycle continues until burnout or insanity/toxicity sets in).

I've shared this presentation with every team I've worked with since 2016. I'm making it public now and would like to revisit it and refresh my thoughts based on some of my more recent experiences.
