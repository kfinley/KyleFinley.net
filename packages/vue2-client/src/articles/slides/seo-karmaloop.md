For about a year in 2012/2013 I worked a challenging role as the Search & Social Manager for karmaloop.com. In this role I reported to the CTO and the Director of Marketing and oversaw all things SEO and Social Media. This included a social following of around 750,000 followers across the major social networks when I started the role and around 1.5 million when I left.

This is a presentation I gave to KarmaLoop CEO Gregg Selko in the summer of 2013 detailing the SEO focused work that would be done during our final push into the holiday sales season.
