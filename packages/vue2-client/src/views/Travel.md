# Kyle Finley's Travels

</div>

I've been a traveler for most of my adult life. I flew around the country as a consultant for 5 years after college and I found
the Couch Surfing community very early on. I've driven around most of the country in my Jeep Wrangler or lately in a Gen 2 Subaru Outback wagon named Su. These days I do lots of driving between the west coast, Colorado, and my home state down south. I enjoy camping on public land as much as possible on my road trips and I stand up paddleboarding as many remote places as I can (Horseshoe Springs, UT is a great spot!).

I'll update this page with more info and links soon!
