      <h2 class="text-center">Mid / Late 90's - Script kiddie turned network admin</h2>
      <p>
        I started with an Apple PowerBook 190cs and spending most my nights on #macfilez or making very basic websites. I started working for my hometown school district pretty soon after they caught me hacking into the high school dial-in unix box. Back the gig was mostly wiring old school buildings with cat5 and fiber plus installing NT4 to replace a couple of even older Novel boxes that were running things. I did the whole certification thing and got A+, Network+, and MCSE certified while working at a tech training center as an assistant network admin & lab assistant. I also bought stock in Apple in 1997... that was one of my better ideas!!

      <h2 class="text-center">Early 2000's - From network admin to coder</h2>
      <p>
        Through early college I continued working for my hometown school district where I designed and implemented a multi-campus single Win2k Active Directory domain using point-to-point tunneling VPN servers between 4 campuses and the admin building. This reduced the number of standalone domains in the district from around 10 to 1 and is still the foundation of the system today (20+ years later).

        I worked my fair share of help desk as I bounced around colleges a little bit then ended up at the University of Colorado studying Business Information Systems. While at CU I was a TA for the programming courses in the business school for a couple of years and I also got my first real programming gig working for the Leeds School of Business building a custom contact management system and other web based stuff.

      <h2 class="text-center">Mid 2000's - Traveling Tech Consultant</h2>
      <h3>Hitachi Consulting</h3>
      <p>
        After college I worked as a consultant with Hitachi Consulting for about 5 years doing mostly custom software and BI systems. I enjoyed the travel but didn't enjoy the company or most of the work. The region I worked in didn't focus on custom software and despite my best efforts to work in other markets I got pigeonholed into doing way too much BI and report conversion projects (if you ask me to convert a crystal report I may kick you!!). I eventually took a leave of absence and traveled the US kiteboarding, snowboarding, and camping before returning to the company to then be fired. I regret not leaving the company sooner.

      <h3>Dining In</h3>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2009 I took a gig with DiningIn.com. They were the first online food ordering company that moved from fax based order to online orders. I learned a lot in the year or so I survived at the company (I left by choice I should mention). The environment was brutal with a single owner that fired most of the employees I saw. Best takeaways from this gig were really learning SEO and reducing paper waste from faxes by 750,000 pieces of paper annually by redesigning the ordering system and what was sent to restaurants after an order was placed online (yes... faxes! The food industry worked on faxes for way longer than you'd think).

        DI was acquired by GrubHub.
      </p>
      <h3>First Giving</h3>
      <p>
        To escape DI I took a senior dev gig at FirstGiving.com where I helped a small team build a social fundraising platform. I worked with a few great people but unfortunately the leadership team wasn't honest with the company. A combination of excessive spending and secret projects with a secret in SF that never produced anything of value led to a massive company layoff event (which I was part of but then asked to remain onboard... which I shouldn't have).
      </p>
      <p>
        FG was eventually acquired by FrontStream.com.
      </p>
      <h3>KarmaLoop</h3>
      <p>
        From there I moved into eCommerce working with KarmaLoop.com. This place was totally nuts! Fun but just crazy town on almost a daily basis. The potential was huge here and I learned a lot while working as a senior dev and then as their Search & Social Optimization Manager leading the social marketing team within the marketing department. Straddling the Tech and Marketing department while reporting to both the CTO and the director of marketing was an adventure to say the least! Buy me a beer and I'll tell you some crazy stories.

        KL was acquired by Shiekh Shoes (after going bankrupt with over 900M in debt).

      <h3>LeanBox</h3>
      <p>
        Around 2015 I found myself back in the food industry but with a twist. I started working for LeanBox.com helping them rebuild the backend and tablet based self service kiosks that ran their in office refrigerator based vending machines. The concept was pretty cool but the existing implementation was pretty rough. The managers and owners of this place were pretty unethical and after being asked to create a fraudulent reporting system and refusing to do so I was fired .
      </p>
      <p>
        LeanBox was acquired by garten in 2021.

      <h3>Bend Financial</h3>
      <p>
        After my time back in food land I joined some former colleagues that had hooked up with an angel funded startup in the financial industry building an HSA Platform. I joined the group too late to have much impact on the platform architecture working with a group that had no real interest in what I had to say, but I stuck around for a while before moving across the country and working remote. My biggest takeaways from this gig were using Vue with TypeScript was great, there are advantages to being a polyglot (especially in a cloud environment, but only with teams that agree w this), only fools roll their own CloudFormation, and if your deployment takes 45m to an hour you're 100% doing it wrong.
      </p>
      <p>Bend Financial was acquired by HSA Bank in 2022.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center">Early 2020's - Pandemic & Golf</h2>
      <p>
        After leaving Bend I took some time off. It was a super toxic place to work so I wanted some time to recover and enjoy living in San Francisco. Unfortunately only a couple of months into my mini-retirement the pandemic hit. Since I'd been working remote off and on for many years I knew the world was in for a wild ride. I decided to not worry about work for a bit and bought a couple of old Subarues, learned how to work on them, and traveled a lot. In 2020 I spent ~50 nights in a tent between June and November mostly in the US Southwest states.
      </p>
      <h3>SwingU</h3>
        <p>
          In 2021 I joined an established startup in the golf app market. (yeah... I know... me as a golfer! :laugh:) The company was running on some pretty old tech so the goal was to help move them off of a single EC2 instance to a more modern cloud stack that could scale. There were many challenges and the typical toxic people problem but sadly along the way the product manager died in front of the company while presenting at the first all-hands meeting back in the office since the start of the pandemic. I should have walked at this point but I stuck around until it got worse.
      </p>
      <p>I attempted to meet with the CEO to discuss a plan for how I'd agree to continuing to work at the company but was fired the day before the meeting by the CTO (who was soon thereafter fired by the CEO).

      <h3>Sports Tracker & Coaching Platform</h3>
      <p>
       In the spring 2022 I started trying to work with my father and brother on what I hoped would be the foundation of a company the three of us could work on together. The plan was to create a collection of apps targeting a variety of sports that would assist with tracking typical statistics as they relate to each sport as well as health data while performing. I wanted to borrow from my dad's concept of "Is my patient OK?" and build into the platform the ability for individuals to gain insights into their general health and wellbeing from the health data tracked while performing their individual sports. I thought these concepts combined with a coaching marketplace would be a solid business to throw my time at.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately my father passed away in late June only a month or so after we started working on things. I took a lot of time off at this point and got back to working on the ideas alone in late 2022.</p>
      <h3>Holeshot BMX</h3>
      <p>
        In January of 2023 I joined my brother at the Silver Dollar National USA BMX Race in Las Vegas, NV. I raced my first race since October of 1988 and made it to mains coming home with hardware. My goal was to not finish last and I did that!
      </p>
      <p>
        While in Las Vegas I showed my brother what I'd been working on and after the weekend continued working on the platform. I'm still working on things and we're accepting sign ups for the wait list now at <a href="https://holeshot-bmx.com" target="new">holeshot-bmx.com</a>.

      <h3>Longboard / Skate Tracker</h3>
      <p>
        I'm working on a combination standalone WatchOS and web app that will track longboard sessions and health data and will add updates when I'm ready to share.
      </p>
      <h3>Sewing Project & Materials Tracker</h3>
      <p>
        I've been talking with my partner for a while now about building her a system that helps her track her sewing projects. She's currently using a Google sheet and needs something better. We have some great ideas and there's an opportunity for a real product there but I'm just starting to get into working on this and will update with links when I have something to share.
