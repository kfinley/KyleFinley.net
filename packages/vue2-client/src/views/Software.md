# Software & Tech

</div>

<div class="text-center pb-2">

I've worked in and around tech now for over 20 years. I started doing tech work at the end of high school when I was pulling cables and setting up networks and servers for my hometown public school district. In college I moved into writing software while working in IT support. After college I consulted for a large US based tech firm working with large clients all over the US. After leaving consulting I started working in the startup world on the east coast.

I'm always working on several projects. Below you'll find info on my previous work and what kind of software things I'm up to lately.

      <h3>Sports Tracker & Coaching Platform</h3>
      <p>
        I spent the majority of late Spring and early Summer of 2022 working on a startup idea I had with some family members. The plan was to create a collection of progressive web apps that all use a common back end platform. These apps would be targeted at specific sports and would provide tools for scheduling, tracking (stats as well as health data), coaching, and more. The project got derailed after a loss in the family but I still have hopes to continue working on it more.

      <h3>Sewing Project & Materials Tracker</h3>
      <p>
        I've been talking with my partner for a while now about building her a system that helps her track her sewing projects. She's currently using a G sheet and needs something better. We have some great ideas and there's an opportunity for a real product there but I'm just starting to get into working on this and will update with links when I have something to share.

        <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/TypeMerger" target="new">TypeMerger</a> is a small project I've maintained for over 10 years. I don't use it anymore but people still find it handy. It's a simple convention-based object merger for .NET. It allows two objects of any type to be merged into a new Type. Object properties can be ignored and any collisions can be resolved using a fluent api. The object returned is a new Type that is dynamically generated and loaded using System.Reflection.Emit.

      <h3>Script kiddie &#8594; network admin</h3>
      <p>
        I started taking computers seriously when I got an Apple PowerBook 190cs in high school. I was quickly spending most my nights on #macfilez reading anything I could get my hands on and started making very basic websites. I started working for my hometown school district pretty soon after they caught me hacking into the high school dial-in unix box. Back then the gig was mostly wiring old school buildings with cat5 and fiber and maintaining NT4 or Novel boxes that were running things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did the whole certification thing and got A+, Network+, and MCSE certified while working at a tech training center as an assistant network admin & lab assistant. I also bought stock in Apple in 1997... that was one of my better ideas!!

      <h2>Early 2000s</h2>
      <h3>From network admin &#8594; coder</h3>
      <p>
        Through early college I continued working for my hometown school district. One summer I designed and implemented a multi-campus single Win2k Active Directory domain using point-to-point tunneling VPN servers (ISA boxes) between 4 campuses and the admin building. This reduced the number of standalone domains in the district from around 10 to 1. This also let me easily work remote. This setup is still the foundation for the system they run today (20+ years later).
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked my fair share of help desk jobs as I bounced around colleges before ending up at the University of Colorado studying Business Information Systems. While at CU I was a TA for the programming courses in the business school for a couple of years and I also got my first real programming gig working for the Leeds School of Business building a custom contact management system and other web based stuff.

      <h3>Hitachi Consulting</h3>
      <p>
        After college I worked as a consultant with Hitachi Consulting for about 5 years doing mostly custom software and BI systems. I enjoyed the travel but didn't enjoy the company or most of the work. The region I worked in didn't focus on custom software and despite my best efforts to work in other markets I got pigeonholed into doing way too much BI and report conversion projects (if you ask me to convert a crystal report I may kick you!!).
      </p>
      <p>
        I eventually took a leave of absence and traveled the US kiteboarding, snowboarding, and camping before returning to the company to then be fired. I shouldn't have stayed there as long as I did but I still learned a lot of non-code related skills and by the end I ran teams, trained customer employees, and wrote my own statements of work. I also fell in love with traveling during this period.

      <h3>Dining In</h3>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2009 I took a gig with DiningIn.com. They were one of the firsts in online food ordering. I learned a lot in the year or so I survived at the company (I left by choice I should mention). The environment was brutal with a single owner that fired most of the employees I saw. Best takeaways from this gig were really learning SEO and more importantly reducing paper waste from faxes by more than 750,000 pieces of paper annually. I did this by redesigning the ordering system report that was generated after an online order and then electronically faxed to the restaurant (yes... faxes! We had two T1s dedicated for faxing restaurants. The food industry worked on faxes for way longer than you'd think).

      <h3>FirstGiving</h3>
      <p>
        To escape DingingIn I took a senior dev gig at FirstGiving.com. There I helped a small team build a social fundraising platform. I worked with a few great people but unfortunately the leadership team wasn't honest with the company. A combination of excessive spending and unsuccessful secret projects with a remote team in SF led to a substantial company layoff event (which I was part of but then asked to remain onboard... which I shouldn't have).

      <h3>KarmaLoop</h3>
      <p>
        From FirstGiving I moved into eCommerce working with KarmaLoop.com. This place was totally nuts!!! Fun but just crazy town on almost a daily basis. The potential was huge and I learned a lot while working as a senior dev and then as a Search & Social Optimization Manager leading the social marketing team within the marketing department. Straddling the Tech and Marketing department while reporting to both the CTO and the director of marketing was an adventure to say the least! Probably one of the most insane thing I ever heard from a C level was at this company... "Start with the profitable. If it isn't legal we'll figure out how to make it legal." Buy me a beer and I'll tell you some crazy stories.

        KarmaLoop was acquired by Comvest Capital and CapX for $13M after filing bankruptcy in 2015. In 2016 Shiekh Shoes purchased the KarmaLoop brand. Shiekh Shoes filed for bankruptcy in 2017.

      <h3>LeanBox</h3>
      <p>
        By the mid-2010s I found myself back in the food industry but this time with an IoT flare. I joined LeanBox.com to help them adopt Agile and rebuild the backend and tablet based self service kiosks that ran their in-office refrigerator based vending machines. The concept was pretty cool but the existing implementation was pretty rough. Unfortunately the managers and owners of the place were pretty unethical. I was gone pretty soon after I was asked to create a fraudulent reporting system (which I refused to do) and informed them that they were overcharging customers (which they ignored).

      <h3>Bend Financial</h3>
      <p>
        After my fun time back in the food industry I joined some former colleagues that had hooked up with an angel funded financial startup building an HSA Platform. Unfortunately I joined far too late to have much impact on the platform architecture and quickly found myself working with a group that had no real interest in what I had to say. I stuck around for a while before moving across the country and working remote.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned a lot through this experience. It was exciting to help bring a greenfield product to consumers in under 12 months. My biggest takeaways from this gig were that using Vue with TypeScript was pretty great, there are many advantages to having a polyglot architecture (especially in a cloud environment when it relates to speed & cost), only fools roll their own CloudFormation, and if your deployment takes 45m to an hour from commit to production then you're 100% doing it wrong!

      <h3>Pandemic & Golf</h3>
      <p>
        After leaving Bend I took some time off. It was a super toxic place to work so I wanted some time to recover and enjoy living in San Francisco. Unfortunately only a couple of months into my mini-retirement the pandemic hit. Since I'd been working remote off and on for many years I knew the world was in for a wild ride. I decided to not worry about work for a bit and bought a couple of old Subarus, learned how to work on them, and traveled a lot. In 2020 I spent ~50 nights in a tent between June and November mostly in the US southwest states.

      <h3>SwingU</h3>
        <p>
          In 2021 I joined an established startup in the golf app market. The company was running on some pretty old tech so the goal was to help move them off of a single EC2 instance running mostly legacy .NET Framework 4.7 to a modern cloud stack that could scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned a lot while working with this company. I prepared a recommendation for how to structure the existing teams in a way that lined up with both the realities of how the product worked and in a way I was willing to continue to work there. I wasn't able to deliver this to the CEO as intended but I shared the presentation with him after I left the company.
