When I choose to work I'm usually doing software and systems development. I've been in tech for a while and it's been a journey. I
started out working for my hometown school district right out of high school. Back then we were wiring old school buildings and
installing servers. I did the whole MCSE thing while still in college while working at a training center. Then I was a TA for the
programming courses in the business school at University of Colorado. There I took my first real programming gig working for the B
School building a custom contact management system and other web based stuff. After college I worked as a consultant with a big US
based firm for about 5 years doing mostly custom software and BI systems. Then I moved into the crazy world of tech startups where
I've been working off and on now for over 10 years. I've worked for lots of crazy startups that's for sure. I mostly done work
building transaction based systems, financial platforms, e-commerce systems, food order / delivery systems, web scrapping / data
harvesting, sports community and coaching systems, DevOps related stuff, and some data related things. I'm a recovering Agile
Practitioner and prefer working with pure Kanban in a Lean Software Process derived from the Toyota Product System principles. I
also spent some time as a technical growth hacker / SEO dude. I dig organic growth marketing but I've been off of social networks
for almost 10 years now so it's not something I focus on these days. I'm always working on something and these days it's mostly
personal projects.

TODO... finish this!<br>
