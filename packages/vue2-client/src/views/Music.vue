      <li>
        <em>Open Jazz Jam @ The Lucky Horseshoe</em> - I run this jam at the Shoe ever 3rd Wednesday of the Month 8-11pm. We aim to have

        through.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Sunday Bluegrass Jam @ <a href="https://www.theluckyhorseshoebar.com/" target="Shoe">The Lucky Horseshoe</a></em>
        - This was a great jam when Frank Holmes ran it and I enjoyed playing there every week for several years. I don't go anymore due to
        the attitudes and comments made by some of the current players while on stage. I'm often told by younger musicians I meet around
        town about the negative experiences they've had at this jam. It's a real shame because this is one of the longest running jams in SF
        and it used to be a great way to spend Sunday evenings with some of the best players in bay area. Unfortunately those days are long
        gone. Now many of the older top notch players won't come anymore since the new leader took over.
      </li>
      <li>

        near Stowe Lake on JFK.
      </li>
      <li><em>Ocean Ale House Jazz Jam</em> - Weekly Jazz Jam on Wednesday Nights in Monterey Heights</li>
      <li>
        <em>Madrone Jazz Jam</em> - Weekly Jazz Jam on Sunday nights at Madrone Art Bar in Alamo Square. I don't go to this one very often

    <h4 class="text-center">My Musical Journey</h4>
    <p>
      I've been playing music now for over 30 years. I grew up hiding out in the band hall with the other cool kids playing lots of stuff.
      When I was 11 I joined beginner band at school. I picked the trombone because that's what my dad played. He let me use his Bach
      Stradivarius he bought in high school after he quit playing football due to a serious game injury. I'm lucky and come from good stock
      of musical talent so playing music came pretty naturally for me. I played the trombone through high school and college, then it was
      almost lost in a house fire so he asked for it back to hold for safe keeping. Luckily I now have my father's horn back and I'm
      actively chopping wood in Golden Gate Park with the goal of playing my first public shows soon!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was about 13 I got a cheap electric bass guitar (and an even cheaper garage sale acoustic guitar). I started playing bass
      because of people like Cliff Burton, Les Claypool, Jeff Ament, and Flea. I started taking lessons from my friend and band director
      <a href="http://jeffmadlock.com" target="Jeff">Jeff Madlock</a> and he started grooming me for high school jazz band. I continued with
      guitar, and still play it a lot, but since moving to upright bass in early high school I've considered myself primarily a bass player.
      When it comes to bass I'm most influenced by Ray Brown, Paul Chambers, Oscar Pettiford, Ron Carter, Christian McBride, and of course
      Jimmy Blanton.
    </p>
    <p>
      In high school I was a 3 time All-State Jazz Band member, from it's inaugural year through graduation. I also made All-State Orchestra
      on Bass my senior year without ever playing in an orchestra before and performed in both the Jazz and Orchestra bands the same
      weekend. I received both the John Philip Sousa and Louis Armstrong Jazz Award my senior year. I attended the Jamey Aebersold Jazz Camp
      in 1995 which was where I learned how to walk bass lines from Jamey Aebersold himself (the dude played everything). I also attended
      Arkansas Governors School in the Music Area in 1997. Governors School was a great experience for me. I learned a lot! It's a real
      shame that Ava Hutchinson felt compelled to destroy the program for no good reason other than blind ignorant christian conservatism.
      The destruction of program was a true loss for the Arkansas education system and more importantly took away a learning opportunity for
      smart kids and gifted artists in the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took music pretty seriously through the end of high school was set to attend the University of North Florida with a full ride for
      jazz studies but for various reasons decided to focus on tech stuff in college and ended up starting at the University of North Texas.
      I bounced around schools a bit and landing at the University of Colorado where I played in one of the CU Jazz Combos under Chip
      Stephens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately I let music fall to the back burner after school while I was working as a traveling consultant. I tried to get back to
      playing around 2012 but after an extremely overpriced botched overhaul of my bass I was so upset I couldn't even play it. Sadly it sat
      in the corner for another 6 years or so before I started playing seriously again. (Don't ever trust or use Upton... just sayin'.)
      Getting back to playing bass was interesting, I randomly meet a Berklee Comp kid while kiteboarding at the beach in Boston and he
      invited me to join him at a bluegrass jam in Jamaica Plain. I thought why not! Bluegrass is easy enough right? That should be a good
      place to get my chops back! So I started playing bass with them weekly. They're a great crew and lately they play Sundays at a bar or
      brewery in Jamaica Plain or at the JP pond in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the summery of 2019 I moved across the country and landed in SF. I found The Lucky Horseshoe weekly bluegrass jam run by Frank
      Holmes my first week in town. I was the regular bass player for the Shoe Jam for almost 4 years, from July 2019 through the pandemic
      and into it's transition to a new leader (roughly May 2023). I still drop by and play at the jam most weeks but I don't play the full
      3 hour gauntlet anymore!
    </p>
    <p>
      I started focusing on jazz again as my primary genre a few years back and these days I'm playing around SF with a few groups. I host a
      monthly Open Jazz Jam at <a href="https://www.theluckyhorseshoebar.com/" target="Shoe">The Lucky Horseshoe</a> every 3rd Wednesday of
      the month. Sometimes we have impromptu "Overtime" jazz jams at the Shoe after the Bluegrass Jam on Sunday nights. You can also catch
      me there on random Tuesdays with a guitar player playing jazz. I've been working with the bartenders to turn the Shoe into a solid low
      key jazz room and we're starting to get some real traction! Feel free to hit me up if you have a jazz group and want to book at night
      at the Shoe and I can sync you up with the head bartender or owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm available for hire and looking for players to form both a regular gigging jazz group and a progressive bluegrass / Americana
      group. You can reach me directly at <a href="mailto:kyle@kylefinley.net">Kyle@KyleFinley.net</a>.
