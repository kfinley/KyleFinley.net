I'm in the process of migrating my site from some really old code to new code and new cloud setup. This version of the site is running on Vue2 as a SPA with very little regard for the big bad search engine and what it thinks... The content has been migrated but there's still more to do. I'll try to do an article on the setup once I get it mostly stable and have time.
