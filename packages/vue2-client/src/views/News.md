I'm in the process of migrating my site from some really old code to new code and new cloud setup. This version of the site is running on Vue2 as a SPA with very little regard for the big bad search engine and what it thinks... The content has been migrated but there's still more to do. I'll try to do an article on the setup once I get it mostly stable and have time.

First release of the new site is done. Some bugs remain but the content is migrated and pages load in desired browsers. Static sitemap in place. Sh!ty Articles listing page still in place (no sort. just dump of folder content).

GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline in place. Migrated DNS from Arvixe to AWS Route53 using CDK.

I'm Going camping and may clone this repo and launch a dedicated camping personal journal site.
