        <h2 class="text-center section-header">Growth Hacking</h2>
        <p>I've been a Software Developer and Technologist for over 10 years and have worked in varioius industries with
          both large and small companies. In the last few years I've focused a lot of my efforts on Search & Social
          Optimization in order to grow organic inbound traffic. I'm passionate about identifying opportunities to
          increase traffic through organic channels and making code level to assist with both improving SEO and
          simplifying Analytics.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center section-header">Photography</h2>
        <p>I photograph for fun and for work. I mostly enjoy "in the wild" product photography for use on Social Media
          and also take a lot of Cocktail Photos in and around the many great bars in Boston. I also enjoy night
          photography, portraits, and the occasional action shots of kiteboarding, snowboarding, skateboarding, and live
          music.</p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2 class="text-center section-header">Kiteboarding</h2>
        <p>Kitesurfing is my current alternative sport of choice. I grew up skateboarding and then snowboarding and
          found kiteboarding when I moved to Boston. I've been kiting now for almost 10 years and enjoy getting out on
          the water as often as I can. I've traveled around the US kiteboarding a lot and have kiteboarded almost all
          the coastal states. I hope to finish all 18 states in the next few years.</p>

        <div>
          <p> A common issue with most websites is inflated direct traffic due to website owners or employees visiting
            the site on a regular basis. There are several options for how to filter traffic in Google Analytics
            including using the user's IP Address, Network Domain, or Custom Dimension. The simplest solution is to
            filter by IP Address but if you are like most nomadic workers and don't have a consistent Office or IP
            address this results in creating and editing filters all the time. That's a pain! A[...]</p>

            your visits and as a result really mess up your Bounce Rates, Conversion Rates, and more. There are tons of
            article out there on how to fight referrer spammers and several techniques. I typically rely on creating
            filters in Google Analytics and applying them to my views. This can be very time consuming if you try to

          <p> If you're serious about Social Media then you probably already use some type of scheduling to handle some

            scheduling status updates but it doesn't really do what I want. What I'd rather have is a scheduling option

            and marketing tools and reports. Here are my requirements for what[...]</p>

          <p> It's a question we all hate to hear, "Are you Done yet?" or the more common "When do you think you'll be
            done?" In our head we hear the answer, "Never!" but that's not what we say. We answer the question when will
            we be Finished and this is often not the same thing as "Done" in the mind of the person asking the question.
            The problem is that in Software development, especially in larger Systems Development, nothing is ever
            really Done, it's only finished to the standards of the requested[...]</p>
